# Generate Social Media Images With Cloudinary

This site creates social media sharing cards for the [Netlify blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=netlify-social-images-jl&utm_campaign=devex). It’s powered by [Cloudinary](https://jason.af/cloudinary) and [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=netlify-social-images-jl&utm_campaign=devex).

The images look something like this:

![Add the title of the article you’re sharing! Wow!
